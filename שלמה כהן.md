According to Aunt Miriam his last name was seidenberg (possibly zeidenberg)

He's the father of [Dov Alexander Cohen](https://github.com/Shayac/genealogy/blob/main/%D7%93%D7%95%D7%91%20%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%A1%D7%A0%D7%93%D7%A8%20%D7%9B%D7%94%D7%9F.md).

According to what we got from calling Mt. Hermon Cemetary Records:  
Samuel (Shlomo) Cohen         Died Feb 9, 1939   (78 Years old) 
so he was born ~1861

however from the מצבה it seems he died aged 76 so he was born ~1863

Here's what seems to be a ship record for when he came over to the USA:

Another where his name is misspelled.

In the [1900 census](https://github.com/Shayac/genealogy/files/6260920/Cohen.Census.1900.pdf) his birthday is listed as May 1861 which works out with the Mt. hermon cemetery records but not the מצבה dates (which places his birthyear ~1863).  
According to the census he was married for 20 years at that time placing his marriage to Becky ~1880.  
According to the census he arrived in 1882 and Beckie arrived in 1884 however this does not add up with the above ship record which indicates an arrival in 1884 for Solomon. It is however possible that 1882 is when he left Szczuczyn as it seems the ship departed from Hamburg Germany in January of 1884.

Died 20 Shvat, 5699 - Feb 9, 1939. Death record https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:2WT8-P24

Another possible link to the siedenberg family from Szczuczyn is here:

It seems that there was a Breidle (wondering if this is Breina, Solomon's wife) and two children (Nissin, age 12 and Debora age 1) that arrived.

Here we have what looks to be a Shlomo Seidenberg marrying a Breina in Szczuczyn:  
https://www.ancestrylibrary.com/family-tree/person/tree/9279003/person/390068131118/story
It has his father as David and his mother as Sheina. This jives well with the David and Saide listed as parents on Solomon's death certificate.  
Additionally, his wife Breina seems to be the daughter of some Berish which would jive well with Dov B. listed as her father on her מצבה.
