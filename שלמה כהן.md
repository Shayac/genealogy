According to Aunt Miriam his last name was seidenberg (possibly zeidenberg)

He's the father of [Dov Alexander Cohen](https://github.com/Shayac/genealogy/blob/main/%D7%93%D7%95%D7%91%20%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%A1%D7%A0%D7%93%D7%A8%20%D7%9B%D7%94%D7%9F.md).

According to what we got from calling Mt. Hermon Cemetary Records:
Samuel (Shlomo) Cohen         Died Feb 9, 1939   (78 Years old) 
so he was born ~1861

however from the מצבה it seems he died aged 76 so he was born ~1863

In the [1900 census](https://github.com/Shayac/genealogy/files/6260920/Cohen.Census.1900.pdf) his birthday is listed as May 1861 which works out with the Mt. hermon מצבה dates.
According to the census he was married for 20 years at that time placing his marriage to Becky ~1880.
